# Data Minded Academy - Introduction to Git
## Exercise 2 - Logs & checkout

In this exercise, you will have to use Git time-machine features. The tasks are the following:

1. Open a terminal and position yourself in the root of this folder (`exercise_2`).

2. Explore the history of the repository to find the answers to the following questions:

    * What was the value of the `TARGET` parameter in the `client.py` at the origin of the repository?

    * How did evolve the value of the `API_VERSION_TO_USE` parameter through the whole Git repository history?

3. Try to use `git diff` to compare file content at different points in time instead of navigating manually using `git checkout`. Try it out with `client.py`.
